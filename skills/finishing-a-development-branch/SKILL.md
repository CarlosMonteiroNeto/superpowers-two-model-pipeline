# Finishing a Development Branch

## Overview

## Pipeline Integration (two-model-sdd-pipeline)

- **The completion gate is a script, not a self-check.** Before any holistic/finishing review, `final-gate WORKSPACE TOTAL_TASKS` must exit 0: all tasks complete, no unresolved reviewer verdicts, no blocking parked items, and tests/analyze both green. This replaces manual "did I finish everything" verification with a deterministic precondition.
- **Closing still needs judgment**, but it starts *after* `final-gate` passes — Agente diretor resumes for the closing assessment (spec coverage, risks, parked triage), so the review isn't polluted by the implementation session's context.
- **Docs are gated too.** If this branch changed the pipeline itself (scripts, skills, invariants, phases), `scripts/doc-check` deterministically fails the branch unless `README.txt` and `README-LLM.md` were updated in the same push. Don't churn docs when behavior didn't change — `doc-check` only cares when it did.


**Core principle:** Verify tests → Detect environment → Push + PR by default → Clean up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."

## Step 1: Verify Tests

On a two-tier pipeline branch, verify with the gate script — not a raw suite run: `green-gate --no-commit` (Flutter) or the ledger's test/analyze commands via `run-gates` (generic). Only the gate's exit 0 counts as green. Otherwise, run the project's full test suite (`npm test` / `cargo test` / `pytest` / `go test ./...`).

**If tests fail**, report the failures and stop — the menu comes after a green suite:

```
Tests failing (<N> failures). Must fix before completing:

[Show failures]
```

**If tests pass:** continue to Step 2.

## Step 2: Detect Environment

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
# Capture now, while still inside the workspace — Step 5 changes directory
# before cleanup (Step 6) needs this value
WORKTREE_PATH=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

This determines which menu to show and how cleanup works:

| State | Menu | Cleanup |
|-------|------|---------|
| `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON` (normal repo) | None (default push + PR) | No worktree to clean up |
| `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`, named branch | None (default push + PR) | Provenance-based (see Step 6) |
| `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`, detached HEAD | Reduced 2 options (no merge) | Externally managed — leave in place |

## Step 3: Determine Base Branch

The base branch is whatever this work forked from — usually named in the
plan, the conversation, or the branch's upstream. If it is not already
known, ask: "This branch split from <your best guess> - is that correct?"
Confirm before merging: merging into the wrong base is expensive to undo.

## Step 4: Integrate (default) or present options (detached only)

**Normal repo and named-branch worktree — no menu.** Default is push +
create a Pull Request: execute it directly and report the
URL. Your human partner asked for the work to land; the menu was pure
friction. Only stop and ask if the push is rejected (investigate —
force-push only on explicit request).

**Detached HEAD — present exactly these 2 options:**

```
Implementation complete. You're on a detached HEAD (externally managed workspace).

1. Push as new branch and create a Pull Request
2. Keep as-is (I'll handle it later)

Which option?
```

Discarding the work happens only in response to your human partner explicitly asking for it (see "If your human partner asks to discard the work" below).

## Step 5: Execute Choice

### Push and Create PR (default)

```bash
git push -u origin <feature-branch>
# From a detached HEAD, name the new branch on the remote:
# git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/<new-branch>
```

Then create the pull/merge request against <base-branch> with the forge's
tooling — its CLI if one is available, or the creation URL most forges
print when you push — following the repo's PR template and conventions if
present, and report the URL to your human partner.

Keep the worktree — your human partner iterates on PR feedback there.

### Keep As-Is (detached menu option 2)

Report: "Keeping branch <name>. Worktree preserved at <path>."

### If your human partner asks to discard the work

This path exists only as a response to an explicit request to throw the
work away. Confirm first:

```
This will permanently delete:
- Branch <name>
- All commits: <commit-list>
- Worktree at <path>

Type 'discard' to confirm.
```

Wait for that exact confirmation. When it arrives:

```bash
MAIN_ROOT=$(git -C "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$MAIN_ROOT"
```

Then clean up the worktree (Step 6) and force-delete the branch:

```bash
git branch -D <feature-branch>
```

## Step 6: Cleanup Workspace

**Runs for confirmed discards only.** Push+PR and keep-as-is always
preserve the worktree. Both callers have already changed directory to the
main repo root — worktree removal must run from outside the worktree —
and use the `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_COMMON`/`WORKTREE_PATH` values captured in
Step 2, from before that directory change.

**If `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON`:** Normal repo, no worktree to clean up. Done.

**If `WORKTREE_PATH` is under `.worktrees/` or `worktrees/`:** Superpowers
created this worktree — we own cleanup:

```bash
git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_PATH"
git worktree prune  # Self-healing: clean up any stale registrations
```

**If removal is refused** (`contains modified or untracked files`): the
worktree holds files that exist nowhere else — uncommitted plans, notes,
or scratch work. Never `--force` on your own initiative. Show your human
partner what is at stake and ask:

```bash
git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" status --porcelain -uall
```

```
Worktree removal refused — these files were never committed:

<file list>

1. Commit them to <branch> before cleanup
2. Move them into <main repo root>
3. Delete them (unrecoverable)

Which?
```

Carry out the choice, then remove the worktree.

**Otherwise:** The host environment owns this workspace — leave it in
place. If your platform provides a workspace-exit tool, use it.

## Quick Reference

| Option | Merge | Push | Keep Worktree | Cleanup Branch |
|--------|-------|------|---------------|----------------|
| Push + PR (default) | - | yes | yes | - |
| Keep as-is (detached only) | - | - | yes | - |
| Discard (explicit request only) | - | - | - | yes (force) |

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Tests passed earlier this session" | Run the suite on the tree you are about to integrate. A green run only proves the tree it ran on. |
| "They obviously want it merged" | Default is push + PR — just do it and report the URL. The menu exists only for detached HEAD. |
| "They seem done with this feature — I'll offer to discard it" | The menu is complete as written. Discard happens only when your human partner asks for it in so many words. |
| "'Yeah, get rid of it' counts as confirmation" | Only the typed word `discard` authorizes deletion. |
| "The PR is up, so the worktree is clutter now" | PR feedback gets fixed in that worktree. It stays until the work lands. |
| "This other worktree looks stale — I'll clean it too" | Clean up only worktrees under `.worktrees/` or `worktrees/`. Everything else belongs to the host. |
| "Removal refused — `--force` is just finishing the cleanup" | The refusal means files exist only in that worktree. `--force` destroys them permanently. Show your human partner and ask. |
| "The merged-result failure is probably flaky" | A failing merged result stops everything. Branch and worktree stay put while you investigate. |
| "The base branch is obviously main" | Confirm the fork point or ask. Merging into the wrong base is expensive to undo. |
| "The push was rejected — force-push will fix it" | A rejected push means the remote moved. Investigate; force-push only on your human partner's explicit request. |
