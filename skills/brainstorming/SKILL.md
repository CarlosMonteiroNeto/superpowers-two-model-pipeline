## Subagent models

Before delegation, follow [the shared model confirmation protocol](../using-superpowers/references/subagent-models.md).
Use `design-reviewer` for the builder check. Reuse this run's confirmed receipt;
do not repeat model confirmation on entering this skill.


# Brainstorming

You are very good at building. You build what you believe your human
partner wants, and that belief is usually thinner than it feels. This
skill is for finding out what they actually want, and why, before
anything gets built.

People often haven't finished working out what they want. Good questions
help them think it through. When you understand the why, you make the
hundred decisions they never mention the way they would have made them.

## First: What Do You Actually Know?

Before you reply, ask yourself: what do I know about what they want, and
why?

- **Everything that matters is in the request** ("make the icon cornflower
  blue"). This is a quick, clear task. Do it, and say what you did.
- **Something non-trivial is missing.** Start the conversation.

Before you start implementing, you must, in order:

1. Lay out the approaches in a message of their own, and have your
   human partner pick one (see Lay out the approaches).
2. Write the design doc, short or full (see Size the Work).
3. Get their approval of that doc.
4. Invoke the superpowers:writing-plans skill.

Two things aren't implementing: a spike they said yes to (see Spike to
feel things out), and doing what they asked once they've opted out of
the questions.

## Look Before You Ask

In an existing project, or when they've given you context (a spec, a plan,
a handoff, files they pointed at, earlier conversation), dig in before your
first message. Read what they referred to and the code or material it
connects to, and keep reading until you can explain how the relevant
parts work today and what this change would touch. Never ask what the
project or their context already answers.

## Your First Message

Move the work forward, with one of these:

- **They've already said what they want** (a spec, a plan, a detailed
  request): aim for about 200 words for the whole message. Echo their
  request back in your own words, so they can see whether you've got its
  shape: what they want, who it's for, and why, as far as they've said.
  Add what you found that bears on it: how the relevant parts work today
  and what the change would touch. If you found something they may not
  have considered that would change what they're asking for or how it
  has to be built, like a constraint, a conflict, or a cheaper path, say
  so plainly. How to build it comes later, once you understand what they
  want (see Lay out the approaches). End with one line inviting
  corrections, then one question about what they want: the thing their
  request leaves open whose answer would most change what gets built.
  Specs are often incomplete, so confirm before you build on one.
- **They haven't:** one open question, in their own terms, about the
  biggest thing their request leaves unsettled. Say why you're asking:
  what the answer would change about what you build. For "a website for
  my bakery": "If it's mostly for people deciding whether to stop by,
  I'd lead with hours and what's in the case today; taking orders is a
  different site. What do you want someone to do when they land on it?"

How the message ends depends on whether their message asked for
brainstorming:

- **They asked for it** (by name, by invoking it, or by asking for a
  design discussion): end with your question. They want this
  conversation.
- **They didn't:** they may not want a conversation at all. After your
  question, add a light, one-line offer to just get going instead, like
  "Or if you'd rather I just dive in, say so." If they take you up on
  it, this skill is done: state any significant how-it-gets-made choice
  (platform, language, medium) in one plain line, then do what they
  asked through the normal workflow.

That's the whole message.

## The Conversation

Each message ends with one question: a single sentence with no list of
example answers hanging off it. Use plain language, pitched just a little
above where your human partner is. Match their vocabulary; never use
process jargon. You never need to quote this skill to your human
partner.

Be clear and concise. Lead with what matters. Avoid jargon. When you
report what you found, give them the most important findings and offer
the rest.

**Get them describing.** Open questions come first. Their own words carry
intent that your options can't. Offer a short menu only when they're
stuck. When they say "just guess" or "what do you think?", propose
something concrete.

**How it gets made.** Every project rests on choices about medium, tools,
materials, and resources: the platform, programming language, and
libraries for an app; the medium for a piece of art. Find out early which
of those choices they want to make, which they're handing to you, and what
they already have to work with. Someone with strong views or skills will
want to talk it through. Someone counting on you needs sensible defaults,
said in plain words. When there's existing work, build on what it already
uses. Any choice you make goes in the design as your call, never as
something they agreed to.

**Ground to cover.** This is territory, not a script. Never read these
out as questions:

- what kind of thing this is, and what makes it special
- why now, and what success looks like to them
- goals, non-goals, and anti-goals (what would make this a failure even
  if it technically works)
- prior art: what they've seen elsewhere, loved or hated
- current state: what exists now, what they've tried
- the details they care about

**Make every question specific** to their project and what they've told
you. Ask Socratically, the way a sharp colleague would: build each
question on their last answer or on something you found, so it helps
them think through a consequence or a case they may have missed
("Voting closes before the meeting, and two members joined this month.
Does someone who joins mid-round get a vote?"). When the reason isn't
already plain, say what you're hoping to learn or what the answer would
change. A proposal they can correct, plus your reason for it, often
beats a question.

**Offer recon.** Once you have a bit of grounding and looking further
would help, offer to go look: deeper into their codebase or project,
their own files and data, or the web. Say what you'd look for. They
decide whether you go.

**Lay out the approaches.** Once you understand what they want, and
before you write anything up, put the ways of building it in a message
of its own. Come up with several real alternatives and drop the weak
ones, including any that work against why they want it and any the
existing work rules out. Present the two or three that remain, grounding
each in what the project actually does and saying what it trades off.
Recommend one and say why, then ask which way they want to go. When
there's genuinely one sensible way, say so and explain why the others
don't fit. This is for how it gets built; for what they want, get them
describing first.

**Show, don't tell.** Offer the visual companion (below) whenever seeing
would help more than reading:

- something they'll look at: a screen, a page, a printout, a sign
- a layout or arrangement: of a screen, a room, a schedule
- a flow or a sequence of steps
- options that would look different from each other
- a structure that's easier to see than read: a diagram, a timeline, a map

Once they've accepted, use it for mockups to react to, side-by-side
options, and throwaway prototypes they can click.

**Spike to feel things out.** Agentic work is waterfall, but very, very
fast. A quick throwaway build is often the cheapest way to learn what
they want or whether something works. Offer one when it would help.
When they just want to spike, get out of the way. Spikes get no tests
or minimal ones, aren't bulletproof, and skip the plan, implementation,
and review process. Bring what the spike taught you back into the
conversation.

## Play It Back

Play back as you go. As soon as you understand one part well enough to
describe it (what it's for and who it serves, say, or how one piece
behaves), describe that part back in about 200-300 words, then return to
questions about the next part. Playback and questions alternate through
the whole conversation; the last chunk covers whatever is left.

Only what they said goes in as theirs. Anything you filled in goes in
as your proposal, with your reason. End each chunk by asking what's wrong
or missing.

Before you send a chunk, check it: does it describe something they'll
look at, like a page, a screen, a schedule, or a printout? If so, and
they haven't seen the visual companion offer yet, send the offer instead
(its own message, below) and hold the chunk for the next message. Once
they've accepted, put a mockup next to the description.

## Classify the Work

Before your first clarifying question, classify the request on two axes
and say both in one plain line: "this is a small change, in the UI area,
so I'll load design-oo-ux". They can override either axis. If the work
grows mid-task, stop and reclassify.

### Axis 1: size

Pick a size and say it in plain words. They can override it.

| Size | The design doc |
|------|----------------|
| A small change | a short one: what you already covered together, written down |
| A project | the full written design (below) |

Short or full, the design doc has an **Approaches** part: the two or
three ways you considered building it, what each trades off, which one
they picked, and why. They pick in the conversation, before you write
the doc.

If it grows mid-task, stop, say so, and step up a size.

### Axis 2: area

After the size, identify every area the work touches and load the matching
overlay skill with the `skill` tool **before** asking design questions.
Progressive disclosure: one stage skill plus at most two overlays. Never
load every overlay at once.

| Area | Load |
|------|------|
| OO/UML/UP modeling, UX prototypes, interface, gestures, motion, materials, typography | `design-oo-ux` |
| Modularity, types, scope, input validation, pure functions | `coding-standards` |
| Test strategy, black/white-box cases, automation, regression | `verification-test` (plus `test-driven-development` when implementing) |
| Done criteria, SQA/SQC, ISO/maturity models | `quality-gate` |
| IaaS/PaaS/SaaS choice, cloud services, IaC, resilience | `cloud-deploy` |
| Scrum roles, ceremonies, backlog refinement, DoR/DoD | `agile-loop` |
| WCAG/POUR accessibility, usability heuristics, ethics | `a11y-ethics` |

- A matched overlay is never skipped. If the request touches that area,
  load it and use it; do not just mention it.
- `design-oo-ux` holds both structure and interface; inside it, interface
  rules win on conflict. Do not load a separate UI skill.
- If two areas are plausible and the request does not decide, ask one
  short question instead of guessing.
- If no area matches, continue with the process skills only. Do not invent
  a domain.

### Greenfield sweep

When the work is a project with a written design and the repo has no
existing flow, do not guess the scope per area. Walk the installed
overlays one by one (`design-oo-ux`, `coding-standards`,
`verification-test`, `cloud-deploy`, `quality-gate`, `agile-loop`,
`a11y-ethics`), ask what the human partner wants in each, record
in-scope/out-of-scope plus an acceptance hint in `CONTEXT.md`, and only
then propose approaches. Each in-scope area becomes a section of the
written design.

### Overlay requirements gate

Every loaded overlay carries mandatory requirements in its
`Checklist`/`Output` sections. Run this gate twice: before writing the
design document, and again before creating the plan.

1. Re-read each loaded overlay's checklist.
2. Turn every item into either a spec section / plan task with acceptance
   criteria, or an explicit out-of-scope decision the human partner
   approved. Silence is not a decision.
3. Never drop an overlay requirement because the work is "mostly" another
   area.

| Overlay | Must appear in the spec and plan |
|---------|----------------------------------|
| `design-oo-ux` | class/object boundaries, one justified UML diagram, UP gate, fidelity ladder, POUR checks, plus interface acceptance (response, 1:1 tracking, interruptibility, springs, momentum, reduced motion) |
| `coding-standards` | module boundaries, types, scope, input validation, purity/global-state rules |
| `verification-test` | test plan, case design, RED scaffold, automation/regression scope |
| `quality-gate` | Definition of Done, SQA/SQC split, cost/metrics |
| `cloud-deploy` | IaaS/PaaS/SaaS decision, service mapping, resilience, IaC |
| `agile-loop` | roles, ceremonies, backlog/INVEST, DoR/DoD |
| `a11y-ethics` | WCAG/POUR criteria, heuristic audit, ethics risks |

The plan is not complete while any loaded overlay row is unanswered.

If this is really several independent projects, say so, agree on an
order, and brainstorm them one at a time.

## The Written Design

Write a plain document a talented builder in the domain could plan
from without going back to your human partner. Cover:

- intent and the why
- goals, non-goals, anti-goals
- constraints
- approaches (above)
- the parts of the how they decided, as they decided them
- what's left to the builder

For a small change, the short design covers the same points in a line
or two each and goes straight to your human partner, without the
builder check.

**Where it goes:** in a software repo,
`docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`, committed.
Otherwise, ask. Your human partner's preferences override both.

**Builder check** (for a project): dispatch a fresh subagent with
`builder-check-prompt.md` in this directory. When you tell your human
partner you're writing it up, say a reviewer will read it first and you
may come back once with a few questions. Don't hand over the document
until the check is back. Sort what the builder asks into three piles:

- **Answered already** by the conversation or the project: put the answer
  in the document.
- **Minor:** a sensible builder could settle it without changing what gets
  built. Settle it yourself and mark it in the document as your call.
- **Theirs:** only your human partner can answer it, and the answer changes
  what gets built.

Bring the "theirs" pile in one message, most important first. Update the
document with their answers, then hand it over with a short list of the
calls you made so they can check those while reading. That's the only
round of questions the check produces. Without a subagent tool, read the
document as that builder yourself.

<HARD-GATE>
Nothing gets built until your human partner approves the design doc:
the short one for a small change, the full one for a project.
Building includes writing product code, scaffolding, installing
dependencies, creating projects, and invoking an implementation skill.
Reading and exploring are fine.

Two exceptions. If they opted out of the questions, the skill is done
and the gate goes with it. A spike they said yes to may be built; it
stays labeled throwaway, and keeping what it produced is a new request
that comes back through this gate.

After the design doc is approved, the next step is the plan: invoke
superpowers:writing-plans and no other skill.
</HARD-GATE>

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "I'll offer a menu of what they might want" | Options steer. Ask them to describe it first. |
| "I'll fill in sensible defaults" | Good. Say them out loud. A default they never heard is one they couldn't reject. |
| "I've answered their questions, so I'll write the doc" | Lay out the approaches first, in a message of their own. |
| "I should explain the process first" | Ask your question. The process shows itself. |
| "They said 'sounds good' to the idea" | Approval covers what you showed them. A design doc you haven't written isn't approved. |
| "The spike works, I'll keep building on it" | Keeping it is a new request. Back through the gate. |
| "It's obviously a quick task, so I'll skip the area check" | Size and area are separate axes. A quick UI task still loads `design-oo-ux`. |
| "I'll write the spec now and fold in the overlay requirements later" | The gate runs before the spec, not after. Unanswered overlay requirements block the plan. |
| "I'll mention the overlay and move on" | Mentioning is not loading. If the area matches, invoke the skill with the `skill` tool. |
| "It's mostly backend, so accessibility doesn't apply" | Any user-facing surface has accessibility and ethics implications. Check the area instead of assuming. |

## Visual Companion

A browser tab for showing mockups, diagrams, and prototypes. It's a
tool, not a mode: accepting it doesn't send every question to the
browser.

**Offer it just-in-time.** Offer it the first time one of the moments
above comes up, never upfront. The offer is its own message with nothing
else in it:

> "This might be easier if I show you. Want me to open a browser tab with some mockups?"

If they decline, stay in text and don't offer again unless they raise it.

**Per question, ask: would they understand this better by seeing it?**
Mockups, layouts, diagrams, and side-by-side designs go in the browser.
Requirements, scope, tradeoffs, and conceptual choices stay in text. A
question about a UI topic isn't automatically a visual question.

If they accept, read `visual-companion.md` in this directory before
starting the server.
